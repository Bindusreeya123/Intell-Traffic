# Intell-Traffic
This project is an AI-based Intelligent Traffic Management System that uses YOLOv8 and OpenCV to analyze traffic videos and automatically detect traffic queues, vehicle speed, overspeed violations, and generate visual evidence for violations. A Streamlit dashboard is provided for interactive visualization, filtering, and monitoring of traffic data.
